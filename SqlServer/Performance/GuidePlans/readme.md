# Creating guide plans
CreatePlanGuide will create a guide plan from a query in the plan cache. This is useful when you have plans you retrieve in SQL Profiler that may have a different carriage return line ending when you go to apply the guide plan in SSMS. 

## Advisory Note
This code is just a sample and not polished.
